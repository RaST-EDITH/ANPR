# ANPR

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project developed using Python and the OpenCV library is a powerful system that automates the detection and
recognition of vehicle license plates. ANPR technology plays a crucial role in various applications such as traffic monitoring, toll collection, parking management
and law enforcement.

The project utilizes the OpenCV library, a popular computer vision library in Python, which provides a wide range of image processing and analysis tools. By
leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV, the ANPR project is able to effectively extract license plate information from images or video streams.

The validation of the number plate is a critical step in the ANPR project. Once the license plate is detected and extracted from the image, the system performs
several validation checks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the recognized number plate. These checks typically involve verifying the plate's structure,
font type, and the presence of valid characters.

First, the system checks if the detected plate has the correct structure, adhering to the specified pattern or format for license plates in a particular region.
This helps eliminate false positives and ensures that only valid license plates are considered.

Next, the system examines the font type used on the plate. It compares the characters on the plate with a predefined set of valid characters, allowing for
variations in font styles, sizes, and orientations. Any inconsistencies or unrecognized characters are flagged for further investigation.

Finally, the system validates the recognized characters based on their position and appearance. It checks for common errors such as missing or illegible characters,
misalignment, or incorrect spacing.

By performing these validation checks, the ANPR project ensures that only accurate license plate information is processed further, increasing the reliability
and efficiency of the overall system. The combination of Python, OpenCV, and intelligent validation techniques makes this ANPR project a powerful tool for
automating license plate recognition tasks.
